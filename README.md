[Computational project : the Game of Life with Tkinter](https://perso.esiee.fr/~georgesj/esiee/igi_3008/igi-3008_19_20.html)

Program the Game of Life (with an Tkinter interface), a simulation of the evolution of cells :
In a rectangular checkerboard of any size, counters are placed. Then, at each generation, cells appear and/or disappear on the checkerboard according to the following rules:
- Survival : any cell close to two or three cells will survive
- Birth: any empty square adjacent to exactly three cells will give birth to a cell
- Death by suffocation : any cell adjacent to four or more cells will die
- Death by isolation: any cell isolating or neighboring a single cell will dies
